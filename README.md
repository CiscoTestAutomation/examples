# pyATS | Library Examples

This repository contains pyATS and its library's usage examples. The purpose
of these examples is not to perform _real testing_, but rather to:

- demonstrate **the various features and functionalities** of the 
  framework using examples and comments

- and demonstrating **how to use the libraries** with example scripts
  using mock devices in `libraries/` folder

```bash

# 1. make sure pyATS is installed (including the libraries)
