Description:
------------
This directory contains a number of standalone scripts that show how
scripts may be written to test parsergen against hardcoded router output.

A mocking infrastructure is set up that "fools" pyAts into "thinking" that
it is talking to a real device, when in reality it is just talking to
a mocked-up stub whose behavior is under the user's complete control.

Since these tests may be run extremely quickly, it is easier than ever to
do quick and iterative parser development.

Example:
python cli_command_formatting_example.py
