## pyATS Clean | Change boot variables & reload device

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:
- change boot variables and
- reload the device

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using N7700 device for the example.
