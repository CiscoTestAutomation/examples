# pyATS | Clean Examples

This repository contains usage examples for the pyATS clean library. These are
not working examples, but rather:

- showcase **the various features and functionalities** of the pyATS clean
  framework

- demonstrate **how to use the pyATS clean libraries**

pyATS Clean is broken down into several 'stages' which are executed in the 'order'
specified within the clean YAML and is therefore highly customizable.

The usecases and examples provided in this section can be merged or combined
to generate your custom order or sequence of pyATS Clean stages.

# 1. make sure pyATS is installed (including the libraries)
