## pyATS Clean | Verify running image on device

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:
- Verify the current running image on device

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using CSR1000v device for the example.
