## pyATS Clean | Remove existing config & load new config without reload

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:

- Remove existing config on the device
- Load new configs on the device

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using N9K device for the example.
