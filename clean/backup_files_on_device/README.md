## pyATS Clean | Backup files present on the device

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:
- Backup files present on the device with prefix 'backup_<filename>'

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using ASR1K device for the example.
