## pyATS Clean | Reload device & apply configuration from a file

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:
- Reload a given device
- Apply configuration from a given file to the device

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using N9K device for the example.
