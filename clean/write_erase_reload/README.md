## pyATS Clean | Write erase and reload the device

This clean YAML demonstrates the simplicity of using the pyATS Clean library as
a pre-execution step to:
- Execute 'write erase'
- Reload the device

The above would run _prior_ to executing any pyATS testcases or scripts.

Note: Using ASR1K device for the example.
